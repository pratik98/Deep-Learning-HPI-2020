LA-Q1 :
Given any square matrix A, is A+A‚ä§ (Transpose A) always symmetric? Why?
No, the square matrix A should fulfill the A=AT(transpose A) requirement, for its sum to be symmetric.

AD - Q1
Why is the second derivative much more expensive to compute than the first derivative?

If we have a function f(x1, . . . , xn) of n variables, then we can take n^2 many second derivatives. also, for second derivative we need  compute first derivative(f') first.

P - Q1
Assume that we have a sequence of random variables, say A, B, and C, where B only depends on A, and C only depends on B, can you simplify the joint probability P(A,B,C)? (Hint: this is a Markov Chain.)

P(A,B,C) = P(A) P(B|A) P(C|B)
