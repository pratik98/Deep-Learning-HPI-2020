An example of such matrices are those that describe pairwise distances, i.e. $M_{ij} = \\|x_i - x_j\\|$. Likewise, the Facebook friendship graph can be written as a symmetric matrix where $M_{ij} = 1$ if $i$ and $j$ are friends and $M_{ij} = 0$ if they are not.

In particular we have that $M_{ii} \\geq \\sum_{j \\neq i} M_{ij}$ and $M_{ii} \\geq \\sum_{j \\neq i} M_{ji}$. If a matrix has this property, we can often approximate $M$ by its diagonal. This is often expressed as $\\mathrm{diag}(M)$.\n","* **Positive Definite Matrix** These are matrices that have the nice property where $x^\\top M x > 0$ whenever $x \\neq 0$. Intuitively, they are a generalization of the squared norm of a vector $\\|x\\|^2 = x^\\top x$. It is easy to check that whenever $M = A^\\top A$, this holds since there $x^\\top M x = x^\\top A^\\top A x = \\|A x\\|^2$.

There are entire subfields of machine learning that focus on using matrix decompositions and their generalizations to high-order tensors to discover structure in datasets and solve prediction problems. But this book focuses on deep learning. And we believe you will be much more inclined to learn more mathematics once you have gotten your hands dirty deploying useful machine learning models on real datasets.

In anomaly detection, we might want to assess how *likely* a set of readings from an airplane's jet engine would be, were it operating normally. In reinforcement learning, we want an agent to act intelligently in an environment. This means we need to think about the probability of getting a high reward under each of the available action. And when we build recommender systems we also need to think about probability. For example, say *hypothetically* that we work for a large online bookseller. We might want to estimate the probability that a particular user would buy a particular book. For this we need to use the language of probability and statistics. Entire courses, majors, theses, careers, and even departments, are devoted to probability. So naturally, our goal in this section isn't to teach the whole subject. Instead we hope to get you off the ground, to teach you just enough that you can start building your first machine\n","learning models, and to give you enough of a flavor for the subject that you can begin to explore it on your own if you wish.\n","\n","\n","We've already invoked probabilities in previous sections without articulating what precisely they are or giving a concrete example.

Probability gives us a\n","formal way of reasoning about our level of certainty. If we are completely sure\n","that the image depicts a cat, we say that the *probability* that the corresponding label $l$ is $\\mathrm{cat}$, denoted $P(l=\\mathrm{cat})$ equals\n","1.0.

If we were reasonably\n","confident, but not sure that the image depicted a cat, we might assign a\n","probability $.5  < P(l=\\mathrm{cat}) < 1.0$.\n","\n","Now consider a second case: given some weather monitoring data, we want to predict the probability that it will rain in Taipei tomorrow. If it's summertime, the rain might come with probability $.5$. In both cases, we have some value of interest.

So probability is a flexible language for reasoning about our level of certainty, and it can be applied effectively in a broad set of contexts.\n","\n","## Basic probability theory\n","\n","Say that we cast a die and want to know what the chance is of seeing a $1$ rather than another digit. If the die is fair, all six outcomes $\\mathcal{X} = \\{1, \\ldots, 6\\}$ are equally likely to occur, and thus we would see a $1$ in $1$ out of $6$ cases.

the six values of the die and gives our estimated probability that the die turns up that value as assessed after each of the 1000 turns. The dashed black line gives the true underlying probability. As we get more data, the solid curves converge towards the true answer.\n","\n","In our example of casting a die, we introduced the notion of a **random variable**. A random variable, which we denote here as $X$ can be pretty much any quantity and is not deterministic. Random variables could take one value among a set of possibilities. We denote sets with brackets, e.g., $\\{\\mathrm{cat}, \\mathrm{dog}, \\mathrm{rabbit}\\}$. The items contained in the set are called *elements*, and we can say that an element $x$ is *in* the set S, by writing $x \\in S$. The symbol $\\in$ is read as \"in\" and denotes membership. For instance, we could truthfully say $\\mathrm{dog} \\in \\{\\mathrm{cat}, \\mathrm{dog}, \\mathrm{rabbit}\\}$. When dealing with the rolls of die, we are concerned with a variable $X \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n","\n","Note that there is a subtle difference between discrete random variables, like the sides of a dice, and continuous ones, like the weight and the height of a person. There's little point in asking whether two people have exactly the same height. If we take precise enough measurements you'll find that no two people on the planet have the exact same height. In fact, if we take a fine enough measurement, you will not have the same height when you wake up and when you go to sleep. So there's no purpose in asking about the probability\n","that someone is $2.00139278291028719210196740527486202$ meters tall. Given the world population of humans the probability is virtually 0. It makes more sense in this case to ask whether someone's height falls into a given interval, say between 1.99 and 2.01 meters. In these cases we quantify the likelihood that we see a value as a *density*. The height of exactly 2.0 meters has no probability, but nonzero density. In the interval between any two different heights we have nonzero probability.\n","\n","\n","There are a few important axioms of probability that you'll want to remember:\n","\n","* For any event $z$, the probability is never negative, i.e. $\\Pr(Z=z) \\geq 0$.\n","* For any two events $Z=z$ and $X=x$ the union is no more likely than the sum of the individual events, i.e. $\\Pr(Z=z \\cup X=x) \\leq \\Pr(Z=z) + \\Pr(X=x)$.\n","* For any random variable, the probabilities of all the values it can take must sum to 1, i.e. $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\Pr(Z=z_i) = 1$.\n","* For any two *mutually exclusive* events $Z=z$ and $X=x$, the probability that either happens is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities, that is $\\Pr(Z=z \\cup X=x) = \\Pr(Z=z) + \\Pr(X=x)$.\n","\n","## Dealing with multiple random variables\n","Very often, we'll want to consider more than one random variable at a time.\n","For instance, we may want to model the relationship between diseases and symptoms. Given a disease and symptom, say 'flu' and 'cough', either may or may not occur in a patient with some probability. While we hope that the probability of both would be close to zero, we may want to estimate these probabilities and their relationships to each other so that we may apply our inferences to effect better medical care.\n","\n","As a more complicated example, images contain millions of pixels, thus millions of random variables. And in many cases images will come with a\n","label, identifying objects in the image. We can also think of the label as a\n","random variable. We can even think of all the metadata as random variables\n","such as location, time, aperture, focal length, ISO, focus distance, camera type, etc. All of these are random variables that occur jointly. When we deal with multiple random variables, there are several quantities of interest. The first is called the joint distribution $\\Pr(A, B)$. Given any elements $a$ and $b$, the joint distribution lets us answer, what is the probability that $A=a$ and $B=b$ simultaneously? Note that for any values $a$ and $b$, $\\Pr(A=a,B=b) \\leq \\Pr(A=a)$.\n","\n","This has to be the case, since for $A$ and $B$ to happen, $A$ has to happen *and* $B$ also has to happen (and vice versa). Thus $A,B$ cannot be more likely than $A$ or $B$ individually. This brings us to an interesting ratio: $0 \\leq \\frac{\\Pr(A,B)}{\\Pr(A)} \\leq 1$. We call this a **conditional probability**\n","and denote it by $\\Pr(B | A)$, the probability that $B$ happens, provided that\n","$A$ has happened.\n","\n","Using the definition of conditional probabilities, we can derive one of the most useful and celebrated equations in statistics—Bayes' theorem.\n","It goes as follows: By construction, we have that $\\Pr(A, B) = \\Pr(B | A) \\Pr(A)$. By symmetry, this also holds for $\\Pr(A,B) = \\Pr(A | B) \\Pr(B)$. Solving for one of the conditional variables we get:\n","\n","$$\\Pr(A | B) = \\frac{\\Pr(B | A) \\Pr(A)}{\\Pr(B)}$$\n","\n","This is very useful if we want to infer one thing from another, say cause and effect but we only know the properties in the reverse direction. One important operation that we need, to make this work, is **marginalization**, i.e., the operation of determining $\\Pr(A)$ and $\\Pr(B)$ from $\\Pr(A,B)$. We can see that the probability of seeing $A$ amounts to accounting for all possible choices of $B$ and aggregating the joint probabilities over all of them, i.e.\n","\n","$$\\Pr(A) = \\sum_{B'} \\Pr(A,B') \\text{ and\n","} \\Pr(B) = \\sum_{A'} \\Pr(A',B)$$\n","\n","Another useful property to check for is **dependence** vs. **independence**.\n","Independence is when the occurrence of one event does not reveal any information about the occurrence of the other. In this case $\\Pr(B | A) = \\Pr(B)$. Statisticians typically express this as $A \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp B$. From Bayes' Theorem, it follows immediately that also $\\Pr(A | B) = \\Pr(A)$. In all other cases we call $A$ and $B$ dependent. For instance, two successive rolls of a die are independent. On the other hand, the position of a light switch and the brightness in the room are not (they are not perfectly deterministic, though, since we could always have a broken lightbulb, power failure, or a broken switch).\n","\n","Let's put our skills to the test. Assume that a doctor administers an AIDS test to a patient. This test is fairly accurate and it fails only with 1% probability if the patient is healthy by reporting him as diseased. Moreover,\n","it never fails to detect HIV if the patient actually has it. We use $D$ to indicate the diagnosis and $H$ to denote the HIV status. Written as a table the outcome $\\Pr(D | H)$ looks as follows:\n","\n","|outcome| HIV positive | HIV negative |\n","|:------------|-------------:|-------------:|\n","|Test positive|            1 |         0.01 |\n","|Test negative|            0 |         0.99 |\n","\n","Note that the column sums are all one (but the row sums aren't), since the conditional probability needs to sum up to $1$, just like the probability. Let us work out the probability of the patient having AIDS if the test comes back positive. Obviously this is going to depend on how common the disease is, since it affects the number of false alarms. Assume that the population is quite healthy, e.g. $\\Pr(\\text{HIV positive}) = 0.0015$. To apply Bayes' Theorem, we need to determine\n","$$\\begin{aligned}\n","\\Pr(\\text{Test positive}) =& \\Pr(D=1 | H=0) \\Pr(H=0) + \\Pr(D=1\n","| H=1) \\Pr(H=1) \\\\\n","=& 0.01 \\cdot 0.9985 + 1 \\cdot 0.0015 \\\\\n","=& 0.011485\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","\n","Thus, we get\n","\n","$$\\begin{aligned} \\Pr(H = 1 | D = 1) =& \\frac{\\Pr(D=1 | H=1) \\Pr(H=1)}{\\Pr(D=1)} \\\\ =& \\frac{1 \\cdot 0.0015}{0.011485} \\\\ =& 0.131 \\end{aligned} $$\n","\n","In other words, there's only a 13.1% chance that the patient actually has AIDS, despite using a test that is 99% accurate. As we can see, statistics can be quite counterintuitive.\n","\n","## Conditional independence\n","What should a patient do upon receiving such terrifying news? Likely, he/she\n","would ask the physician to administer another test to get clarity. The second\n","test has different characteristics (it isn't as good as the first one).\n","\n","|outcome |  HIV positive |  HIV negative |\n","|:------------|--------------:|--------------:|\n","|Test positive|          0.98 |          0.03 |\n","|Test negative|          0.02 |          0.97 |\n","\n","Unfortunately, the second test comes back positive, too. Let us work out the requisite probabilities to invoke Bayes' Theorem.\n","\n","* $\\Pr(D_1 = 1 \\text{ and } D_2 = 1 | H = 0) = 0.01 \\cdot 0.03 = 0.0003$\n","* $\\Pr(D_1 = 1 \\text{ and } D_2 = 1 | H = 1) = 1 \\cdot 0.98 = 0.98$\n","* $\\Pr(D_1 = 1 \\text{ and } D_2 = 1) = 0.0003 \\cdot 0.9985 + 0.98 \\cdot 0.0015 = 0.00176955$\n","* $\\Pr(H = 1 | D_1 = 1 \\text{ and } D_2 = 1) = \\frac{0.98 \\cdot 0.0015}{0.00176955} = 0.831$\n","\n","That is, the second test allowed us to gain much higher confidence that not all is well. Despite the second test being considerably less accurate than the first one, it still improved our estimate quite a bit. You might ask, *why couldn't we just run the first test a second time?* After all, the first test was more accurate. The reason is that we needed a second test whose result is *independent* of the first test (given the true diagnosis). In other words, we made the tacit assumption that $\\Pr(D_1, D_2 | H) = \\Pr(D_1 | H) \\Pr(D_2 | H)$. Statisticians call such random variables **conditionally independent**. This is expressed as $D_1 \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp D_2  | H$.\n","\n","## Sampling\n","\n","Often, when working with probabilistic models, we'll want not just to estimate distributions from data, but also to generate data by sampling from distributions.

will generate 35% zeros and 65% ones.\n","Now what if we have more than two possible outcomes? We can simply generalize\n","this idea as follows. Given any probability distribution, e.g. $p = [0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.3, 0.25, 0.1]$ we can compute its cumulative distribution (python's ``cumsum`` will do this for you) $F = [0.1, 0.3, 0.35, 0.65, 0.9, 1]$. Once we have this we draw a random variable $x$ from the uniform distribution $U[0,1]$ and then find the interval where $F[i-1] \\leq x < F[i]$. We then return $i$ as the sample. By construction, the chances of hitting interval $[F[i-1], F[i])$ has probability $p(i)$.\n","\n","Note that there are many more efficient algorithms for sampling than the one above. For instance, binary search over $F$ will run in $O(\\log n)$ time for $n$ random variables.

trivial. First off, the support is\n","infinite, that is, for any $x$ the density $p(x)$ is positive. Secondly, the\n","density is nonuniform. There are many tricks for sampling from it - the key idea in all algorithms is to stratify $p(x)$ in such a way as to map it to the\n","uniform distribution $U[0,1]$. One way to do this is with the probability\n","integral transform.\n","\n","Denote by $F(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x p(z) dz$ the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $p$. This is in a way the continuous version of the cumulative sum that we used previously. In the same way we can now define the inverse map $F^{-1}(\\xi)$, where $\\xi$ is drawn uniformly. Unlike previously where we needed to find the correct interval for the vector $F$ (i.e. for the piecewise constant function), we now invert the function $F(x)$.\n","\n","In practice, this is slightly more tricky since inverting the CDF is hard in the case of a Gaussian. It turns out that the *twodimensional* integral is much easier to deal with, thus yielding two normal random variables than one, albeit at the price of two uniformly distributed ones. For now, suffice it to say that there are built-in algorithms to address this.\n","\n","The normal distribution has yet another desirable property. In a way all distributions converge to it, if we only average over a sufficiently large number of draws from any other distribution. To understand this in a bit more detail, we need to introduce three important things: expected values, means and variances.\n","\n","* The expected value $\\mathbf{E}_{x \\sim p(x)}[f(x)]$ of a function $f$ under a distribution $p$ is given by the integral $\\int_x p(x) f(x) dx$. That is, we average over all possible outcomes, as given by $p$.\n","* A particularly important expected value is\n","that for the function $f(x) = x$, i.e. $\\mu := \\mathbf{E}_{x \\sim p(x)}[x]$. It\n","provides us with some idea about the typical values of $x$.\n","* Another important quantity is the variance, i.e. the typical deviation from the mean $\\sigma^2 := \\mathbf{E}_{x \\sim p(x)}[(x-\\mu)^2]$. Simple math shows (check it as an exercise) that $\\sigma^2 = \\mathbf{E}_{x \\sim p(x)}[x^2] - \\mathbf{E}^2_{x \\sim p(x)}[x]$.\n","\n","The above allows us to change both mean and variance of random variables. Quite obviously for some random variable $x$ with mean $\\mu$, the random variable $x + c$ has mean $\\mu + c$. Moreover, $\\gamma x$ has the variance $\\gamma^2 \\sigma^2$. Applying this to the normal distribution we see that one with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ has the form $p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\sigma^2 \\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^2} (x-\\mu)^2\\right)$. Note the scaling factor $\\frac{1}{\\sigma}$—it arises from the fact that if we stretch the distribution by $\\sigma$, we need to lower it by $\\frac{1}{\\sigma}$ to retain the same probability mass (i.e. the weight under the distribution always needs to integrate out to 1).\n","\n","Now we are ready to state one of the most fundamental theorems in statistics, the [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem). It states that for sufficiently well-behaved random variables, in particular random variables with well-defined mean and variance, the sum tends toward a normal distribution. To get some idea, let's repeat the experiment described in the beginning, but now using random variables with integer values of $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"iBT_hb1lEuFD","colab_type":"code","outputId":"084bdf09-0f67-4337-9a74-8b2829623cca","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1588406889802,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":9774,"user":{"displayName":"Pratik

If you're interested in going deeper, we recommend consulting a dedicated book on statistics or looking up some common distributions on Wikipedia for further detail. Some important distirbutions to be aware of include:\n","\n","* **Binomial Distribution** It is used to describe the distribution over multiple draws from the same distribution, e.g. the number of heads when tossing a biased coin (i.e. a coin with probability $\\pi \\in [0, 1]$ of returning heads) 10 times. The binomial probability is given by $p(x) = {n \\choose x} \\pi^x (1-\\pi)^{n-x}$.\n","* **Multinomial Distribution** Often, we are concerned with more than two\n","outcomes, e.g. when rolling a dice multiple times. In this case, the\n","distribution is given by $p(x) = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{i=1}^k x_i!} \\prod_{i=1}^k \\pi_i^{x_i}$.\n","* **Poisson Distribution** This distribution models the occurrence of point events that happen with a given rate, e.g. the number of raindrops arriving within a given amount of time in an area (weird fact - the number of Prussian soldiers being killed by horses kicking them followed that distribution). Given a rate $\\lambda$, the number of occurrences is given by $p(x) = \\frac{1}{x!} \\lambda^x e^{-\\lambda}$.\n","* **Beta, Dirichlet, Gamma, and Wishart Distributions** They are what statisticians call *conjugate* to the Binomial, Multinomial, Poisson and Gaussian respectively. Without going into detail, these distributions are often used as priors for coefficients of the latter set of distributions, e.g. a Beta distribution as a prior for modeling the probability for binomial outcomes.\n","\n","\n","\n","## Summary\n","\n","So far, we covered probabilities, independence, conditional independence, and how to use this to draw some basic conclusions. We also introduced some fundamental probability distributions and demonstrated how to sample from them using PyTorch. This is already a powerful bit of knowledge, and by itself a sufficient set of tools for developing some classic machine learning models. In the next section, we will see how to operationalize this knowlege to build your first machine learning model: the Naive Bayes classifier.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Q6vunisf5cx0","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Exercise:** Implement a function that returns the binomial distribution, which describes the number of times we toss a coin (n), each toss is for a fair unbiased coin (p)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ZHKA6l4R5a04","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["def binomial(n, p=0.5):\n","  ## \n","  return torch.distributions.Binomial(n,p)\n","  ## end of function\n","\n","#binomial(10000).sample()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oicPLbufEuFF","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Automatic Differentiation\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MOvXbm_mEuFG","colab_type":"text"},"source":["The autograd package expedites this work by automatically calculating derivatives.

Learning is all about making assumptions. If we want to classify a new data point that we've never seen before we have to make some assumptions about which data points are *similar* to each other.\n","\n","One popular (and remarkably simple) algorithm is the Naive Bayes Classifier. Note that one natural way to express the classification task is via the probabilistic question: *what is the most likely label given the features?*. Formally, we wish to output the prediction $\\hat{y}$ given by the expression:\n","\n","$$\\hat{y} = \\text{argmax}_y \\> p(y | \\mathbf{x})$$\n","\n","Unfortunately, this requires that we estimate $p(y | \\mathbf{x})$ for every value of $\\mathbf{x} = x_1, ..., x_d$. Imagine that each feature could take one of $2$ values. For example, the feature $x_1 = 1$ might signify that the word apple appears in a given document and $x_1 = 0$ would signify that it does not. If we had $30$ such binary features, that would mean that we need to be prepared to classify any of $2^{30}$ (over 1 billion!) possible values of the input vector $\\mathbf{x}$.\n","\n","Moreover, where is the learning? If we need to see every single possible example in order to predict the corresponding label then we're not really learning a pattern but just memorizing the dataset. Fortunately, by making some assumptions about conditional independence, we can introduce some inductive bias and build a model capable of generalizing from a comparatively modest selection of training examples.\n","\n","To begin, let's use Bayes Theorem, to express the classifier as\n","\n","$$\\hat{y} = \\text{argmax}_y \\> \\frac{p( \\mathbf{x} | y) p(y)}{p(\\mathbf{x})}$$\n","\n","Note that the denominator is the normalizing term $p(\\mathbf{x})$ which does not depend on the value of the label $y$. As a result, we only need to worry about comparing the numerator across different values of $y$. Even if calculating the demoninator turned out to be intractable, we could get away with ignoring it, so long as we could evaluate the numerator. Fortunately, however, even if we wanted to recover the normalizing constant, we could, since we know that $\\sum_y p(y | \\mathbf{x}) = 1$, hence we can always recover the normalization term.\n","Now, using the chain rule of probability, we can express the term $p( \\mathbf{x} | y)$ as\n","\n","$$p(x_1 |y) \\cdot p(x_2 | x_1, y) \\cdot ... \\cdot p( x_d | x_1, ..., x_{d-1} y)$$\n","\n","By itself, this expression doesn't get us any further. We still must estimate roughly $2^d$ parameters. However, if we assume that ***the features are conditionally independent of each other, given the label***, then suddenly we're in much better shape, as this term simplifies to $\\prod_i p(x_i | y)$, giving us the predictor\n","\n","$$ \\hat{y} = \\text{argmax}_y \\> = \\prod_i p(x_i | y) p(y)$$\n","\n","Estimating each term in $\\prod_i p(x_i | y)$ amounts to estimating just one parameter. So our assumption of conditional independence has taken the complexity of our model (in terms of the number of parameters) from an exponential dependence on the number of features to a linear dependence. Moreover, we can now make predictions for examples that we've never seen before, because we just need to estimate the terms $p(x_i | y)$, which can be estimated based on a number of different documents.\n","\n","Let's take a closer look at the key assumption that the attributes are all independent of each other, given the labels, i.e., $p(\\mathbf{x} | y) = \\prod_i p(x_i | y)$. Consider classifying emails into spam and ham. It's fair to say that the occurrence of the words `Nigeria`, `prince`, `money`, `rich` are all likely indicators that the e-mail might be spam, whereas `theorem`, `network`, `Bayes` or `statistics` are good indicators that the exchange is less likely to be part of an orchestrated attempt to wheedle out your bank account numbers. Thus, we could model the probability of occurrence for each of these words, given the respective class and then use it to score the likelihood of a text. In fact, for a long time this *is* preciely how many so-called [Bayesian spam filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering) worked."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pTmuhTbWEuFn","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Optical Character Recognition\n","\n","Since images are much easier to deal with, we will illustrate the workings of a Naive Bayes classifier for distinguishing digits on the MNIST dataset. The problem is that we don't actually know $p(y)$ and $p(x_i | y)$. So we need to *estimate* it given some training data first. This is what is called *training* the model. Estimating $p(y)$ is not too hard. Since we are only dealing with 10 classes, this is pretty easy - simply count the number of occurrences $n_y$ for each of the digits and divide it by the total amount of data $n$. For instance, if digit 8 occurs $n_8 = 5,800$ times and we have a total of $n = 60,000$ images, the probability estimate is $p(y=8) = 0.0967$.\n","\n","Now on to slightly more difficult things—$p(x_i | y)$. Since we picked black and white images, $p(x_i | y)$ denotes the probability that pixel $i$ is switched on for class $y$. Just like before we can go and count the number of times $n_{iy}$ such that an event occurs and divide it by the total number of occurrences of y, i.e. $n_y$. But there's something slightly troubling: certain pixels may never be black (e.g. for very well cropped images the corner pixels might always be white). A convenient way for statisticians to deal with this problem is to add pseudo counts to all occurrences. Hence, rather than $n_{iy}$ we use $n_{iy}+1$ and instead of $n_y$ we use $n_{y} + 1$.

At this point it is worth mentioning that we are calculating these numbers on a computer, hence with a fixed range for the exponent. What happens is that we experience *numerical underflow*, i.e. multiplying all the small numbers leads to something even smaller until it is rounded down to zero.
